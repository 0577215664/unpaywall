                    we'll do the work in the background. When you view a paywalled article,
                    we'll search for a free legal copy. When we find one (about 25% of the time
                    right now), you'll see an "unlock" tab on the right of your browser.
                    Click the tab, read the article. Easy.

                <dt>Who's behind Unpaywall?</dt>
                <dd>
                    We're <a href="http://impactstory.org">Impactstory,</a>
                    a nonprofit working to supercharge science by making it
                    more open, reusable, and web-native.
                </dd>

                <dt>Why did you make it?</dt>
                <dd>
                    We got tired of running into paywalled articles! The worst part was, we knew
                    that millions of researchers are currently uploading their own fulltext PDFs
                    to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint">preprint servers</a>
                    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_repository">institutional repositories,</a>
                    worldwide, making them free for anyone to read. There was just no easy 
                    way to find them, especially not one that was integrated into our 
                    reading workflows. So we made one! Over the longer term, our goal for
                    Unpaywall is to nurture the transition to a fully
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">open access</a>
                    scholarly publishing model, by closing the gap between readers and
                    freely-available fulltext.

                </dd>



                <dt>How often does Unpaywall actually find a free PDF for a given article?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Unfortunately not all authors upload their fulltext PDFs online&mdash;although
                    the number is growing every day. So sometimes there's no fulltext available online,
                    and Unpaywall comes up empty. The exact percentage depends on the age
                    and field of the article, but we generally find around 25% success.
                    There's actually been a bunch of research on this recently, and we're planning a blog
                    post breaking it down&mdash;stay tuned.

                </dd>

                <dt>How's this different from Sci-Hub?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Like Unpaywall, Sci-Hub finds fulltext PDFs for paywalled articles. The main difference
                    is where those PDFs come from: Unpaywall finds PDFs legally uploaded
                    by the authors themselves, while
                    Sci-Hub uses PDFs that are obtained by other means, including automated web scraping
                    of publisher sites. Sci-Hub's method delivers more comprehensive results,
                    but is not super legal. So while
                    <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/comparing-sci-hub-oadoi/">we're not against Sci-Hub,</a>
                    we think Unpaywall offers a more sustainable approach by working within copyright law
                    and supporting the growing open access movement.
                </dd>

                <dt>How do you find your fulltext articles?</dt>
                <dd>
                    We gather information from thousands of different open-access repositories with the
                    help many awesome open data sources, especially
                    <a href="https://doaj.org/">the DOAJ,</a>
                    <a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref,</a>
                    <a href="https://www.datacite.org/">DataCite,</a>
                    and <a href="https://www.base-search.net/">BASE.</a>

                    In turn, we make all this data open for reuse via the
                     <a href="http://oadoi.org/about">oaDOI</a> API: a free, fast, and very scalable
                    way to leverage our infrastructure to build your own projects.
                </dd>

                <dt>I found a bug</dt>
                <dd>
                    Sorry about that! Unfortunately this is pretty common, especially where publishers
                    don't follow standard practices for article display (as they often do not).
                    For instance, we don't work for articles missing
                    <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/what-is-doi.aspx">DOIs.</a>

                    The good news is that it's still early days for this project and
                    it's under very active development. When you find an error,
                    <a href="mailto:team@impactstory.org">drop us an email</a> and we'll get it fixed for you.
