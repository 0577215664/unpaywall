                Every time you hit a paywalled article, Unpaywall automatically
                looks for a copy in our index
                of over 20 million free, legal fulltext PDFs.
                If we find one, we give you a link to read. Open access has never been easier.

            <dl>
                <dt>Who is behind Unpaywall?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Unpaywall is from <a href="http://impactstory.org">Impactstory,</a>
                    a nonprofit working to supercharge science by making it
                    more open, reusable, and web-native.
                </dd>

                <dt>Why did you make it?</dt>
                <dd>
                    We got tired of running into paywalled articles! The worst part was, we knew
                    that millions of researchers are currently uploading their own fulltext PDFs
                    to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint">preprint servers</a>
                    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_repository">institutional repositories,</a>
                    worldwide, making them free for anyone to read. There was just no easy 
                    way to find them, especially not one that was integrated into our 
                    reading workflows. So we made one! Our long-term goal with
                    Unpaywall is to nurture the transition to a fully
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">open access</a>
                    scholarly publishing model, by closing the gap between readers and
                    freely-available fulltext.

                <dt>How do I use this?</dt>
                <dd>
                    After you
                    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha">install the extension</a>

                    we'll do the work in the background. When you view a paywalled article,
                    we'll search for a free legal copy. If we find one, you'll see a bright green
                    "free" tab on the right side of your browser window. Click on the tab, read the
                    article. If you want to see an example of Unpaywall working,
                    visit <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673611617522">this article</a>
                    after you've installed the extension.
                </dd>

                <dt>How often does Unpaywall actually find a free PDF for a given article?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Unfortunately not all authors upload their fulltext PDFs online&mdash;although
                    the number is growing every day. So sometimes there's no fulltext available online,
                    and Unpaywall comes up empty. The exact percentage depends on the age
                    and field of the article, but we generally find around 40% success.
                    There's actually been a bunch of research on this recently, and we're planning a blog
                    post breaking it down&mdash;stay tuned.

                <dt>Where does your data come from?</dt>
                <dd>
                    We gather information from thousands of different open-access repositories, with the
                    help of a number of partners. In particular, we depend on data from
                    <a href="https://doaj.org/">the DOAJ,</a>
                    <a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref,</a>
                    <a href="https://www.datacite.org/">DataCite,</a>
                    and (especially) <a href="https://www.base-search.net/">BASE.</a>
                    All this data is available for free via the API of another Impactstory project,
                    <a href="http://oadoi.org">oaDOI.</a>

                    The oaDOI API is fully free,
                    open, and scalable and lots of folks are building cool stuff on it already...check
                    it out if you'd like to build something too!
                </dd>

                <dt>How is this different from Sci-Hub?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Like Unpaywall, Sci-Hub finds fulltext PDFs for paywalled articles. The main difference
                    is where those PDFs come from: Unpaywall finds PDFs legally uploaded
                    by the authors themselves, while
                    Sci-Hub uses PDFs that are obtained by other means including automated web scraping
                    of publisher sites. Sci-Hub's method delivers more comprehensive results,
                    but is not super legal.
                    <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/comparing-sci-hub-oadoi/">We're not against Sci-Hub.</a>
                    But we  think Unpaywall offers a more sustainable approach, by working within copyright law
                    and supporting the growing open access movement.
                </dd>


                <dt>I found a bug</dt>
                <dd>
                    Sorry about that! Unfortunately this is not uncommon, mostly because
                    scholarly publishing is still sort of a wild west of missing and ignored
                    information standards, and this creates a number of problems for automatic systems like
                    Unpaywall. The good news is that it's still early days for this project and
                    it's under very active development. When you find an error,
                    <a href="mailto:team@impactstory.org">drop us an email</a> and we'll get it fixed for you.
