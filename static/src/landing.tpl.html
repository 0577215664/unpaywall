                Ever get stopped by a paywall from reading a scholarly article?
                UnPaywall is here to help.
                <!--
                It’s easy to use: just install the browser extension
                from the Chrome App store, and keep browsing like you normally do.
                -->

                Every time you view a paywalled article, we’ll automatically
                look for a copy in our index
                of over 20 million free, legal fulltext PDFs.
                If we find one, we give you a link and you read. Open access has never been easier.
