                    We're <a href="http://impactstory.org/about">Impactstory,</a>
                    a nonprofit working to make science more open and reusable online.
                    We're supported by grants from <span class="funders">
                    the National Science Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation

                    We loathe paywalls. Now more than ever, humanity needs to <i>access</i> our collective knowledge,
                    not hoard it. Lots of scholars feel the same; that's why they
                    upload their papers to free, legal servers online. We realized that the missing link is in getting
                    these free resources to the people who want them, at the right time. By using a browser extension,
                    we can do that, leveraging the toll-access distribution system to bring
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">open access</a>
                    to the masses.

                <dt id="how-often-finds-fulltext"><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>How often does Unpaywall find full text?</dt>
                <dd>
                    We find fulltext for 84% of articles in <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/top100/2016/">a sample</a> of 2016 research papers that were highly
                    discussed in the media and online.
                    This percentage will vary, depending on the kinds of articles your're looking at.
                    But we generally get fulltext more than half the time. This is improving
                    quickly as we tweak our algorithm and discovery techniques. And over the longer term, we'll keep
                    get even better as
                    mandatory open access requirements begin to take effect in the
                    <a href="http://scholcomm.columbia.edu/open-access/public-access-mandates-for-federally-funded-research/">US,</a>
                    <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/openaccess/">UK,</a>
                    <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/dramatic-statement-european-leaders-call-immediate-open-access-all-scientific-papers/">Europe,</a>
                    and elsewhere. Soon Unpaywall users will essentially have a free subscription to all new research.
                    We think that's a game-changer for open access, and for scholarship as a whole.

                <dt id="different-from-sci-hub"><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>How's this different from Sci-Hub?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Like Unpaywall, Sci-Hub finds fulltext PDFs for paywalled articles. The main difference
                    is where those PDFs come from: Unpaywall finds PDFs legally uploaded
                    by the authors themselves, while
                    Sci-Hub uses PDFs that are obtained by other means, including automated web scraping
                    of publisher sites. Sci-Hub's method delivers more comprehensive results,
                    but is not super legal. So while
                    <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/comparing-sci-hub-oadoi/">we're not against Sci-Hub,</a>
                    we think Unpaywall offers a more sustainable approach by working within copyright law
                    and supporting the growing open access movement.

                <dt id="different-from-oa-button"><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>How's this different from the Open Access Button?</dt>
                <dd>
                    The <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/">OA Button</a> and Unpaywall are similar. But the
                    OA Button is a more mature project
                    (it's been working since 2013), and has a different user interface as well as
                    extra features including author emailing and
                    finding open datasets.
                    Unpaywall is more focused on seamlessly finding free content. The great thing is, both are open-source
                    and free, so you can install both, or
                    <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">fork 'em</a>
                    and make your own better extension!

                <dd>
                    We gather content from thousands of open-access repositories worldwide.
                    To help us, we rely on a number of data sources, including
                    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a>,
                    <a href="https://doaj.org/">the DOAJ,</a>
                    <a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a> (particulary their license info),
                    <a href="https://www.datacite.org/">DataCite,</a>
                    <a href="http://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar,</a>
                    and <a href="https://www.base-search.net/">BASE.</a>

                    After we put all this data together, we in turn make it open for reuse via the
                    <a href="http://oadoi.org/about">oaDOI</a> API: a free, fast, and very scalable
                    way to leverage our data and infrastructure to support your own projects.

                <dd>
                    The extension doesn't store or ask for any personal information from you, so when you use Unpaywall
                    we don't know who you are. The extension doesn't track your browsing history, and it
                    doesn't send any content from any page you visit to our servers, with one exception:
                    when a page has a DOI (a short identifier used by scholarly articles), we send that DOI
                    to our server (using an encrypted HTTPS connection) to find any free versions.
                    We will log requests to our servers
                    (which include the DOI and the IP address the request came from) in order to
                    monitor and improve service. But those logs aren't
                    connected to your identity. Furthermore, the extension won't send or use
                    any kind of browser fingerprinting technology to identify your computer.

                <dd>Indeed we can. Click the green Unpaywall extension icon in
                    your browser toolbar and choose "Settings." Once there, tick "Color-code tab for Green and Gold OA."

                <dd>
                    Sorry about that! Unfortunately this is pretty common, especially where publishers
                    don't follow standard practices for article display (as they often do not).
                    For instance, we don't work for articles missing
                    <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/what-is-doi.aspx">DOIs.</a>

                    The good news is that it's still early days for this project and
                    it's under very active development. When you find an error,
                    <a href="mailto:team@impactstory.org">drop us an email</a> and we'll get it fixed for you.
