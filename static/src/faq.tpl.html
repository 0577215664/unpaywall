                <dd>
                    Overall, Unpaywall users find fulltext for 47% of articles. You may get different results,
                    depending on the age and topic of the articles you're reading. There's more information
                    on how we found these numbers in
                    <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3119v1/">this paper.</a>

                    This success rate will improve as we tweak our algorithm and as
                    mandatory open access requirements take effect in the

                    We harvest content directly from thousands of open-access repositories worldwide.
                    We also use great open data from
                    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a>,

                    Yes! We make all of Unpaywall's data available via the <a href="http://oadoi.org/about">oaDOI API.</a>
                    The oaDOI service is currently used to enrich hundreds of academic libraries, search engines,
                    indexing services, and other tools; it's also used in many research and evaluation projects.

                <dt id="privacy-policy"><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>What's your privacy policy?</dt>
                <dd>
                    The extension doesn't store or ask for any personal information from you, so when you use Unpaywall
                    we don't know who you are. The extension doesn't track your browsing history, and it
                    doesn't send any content from any page you visit to our servers, with one exception:
                    when a page has a DOI (a short identifier used by scholarly articles), we send that DOI
                    to our server (using an encrypted HTTPS connection) to find any free versions.
                    We will log requests to our servers
                    (which include the DOI and the IP address the request came from) in order to
                    monitor and improve service. But those logs aren't
                    connected to your identity. Furthermore, the extension won't send or use
                    any kind of browser fingerprinting technology to identify your computer.
