        <h1>You've installed Unpaywall!</h1>

        <p>
            We'll work in the background when you view research articles. If you see
            the <span class="green">green tab,</span> click it to skip the paywall.
            if you see a <span class="gray">gray tab</span> it means we came up empty.
        </p>
        <p>To get started, try this example article:</p>
        <p>
            <a class="eg" href="http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/454/1969/277">
                Information-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Error Correction and Reversible Measurement.
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            It's paywalled in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society A,</em> but
            Unpaywall finds a free copy uploaded by the authors to the
            <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/">CERN document server.</a>
        </p>
        <p></p>


        <p class="ps">
            PS for the Open Access nerds: if you want to really dive into articles' OA status, the Unpaywall tab
            can change colors to indicate Green or Gold OA, too; enable it in settings.
